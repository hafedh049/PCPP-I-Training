# Python core syntax

So far we have been using Python core operations that allow us to operate on strings, lists, integers, and floats. It’s natural for us to formulate expressions using algebraic symbols representing operators, or to get a number of elements in a sequence or dictionary.

We are able to add two or more strings together, which results in the strings’ concatenation; we are able to add integers and we know what the result should be, all done by using the “+” operator, but on respective data types.

Now, we'll use the same function `len()` to get a number of elements of a tuple, list, dictionary, or characters in a string.

This is Python core syntax – an ability to perform specific operations **on different** data types, when operations are formulated using **the same** operators or instructions, or even functions.

Python core syntax covers:

- operators like '+', '-', '*', '/', '%' and many others;
- operators like '==', '<', '>', '<=', 'in' and many others;
- indexing, slicing, subscripting;
- built-in functions like str(), len()
- reflexion – isinstance(), issubclass()

and a few more elements.

Look at the following simple code:

```python
number = 10  
print(number + 20)       
```  

It is in fact translated to:

```python
number = 10  
print(number.__add__(20))
```

What Python does is it executes the magic method __add__() on the left operand (“number” object in the example) of the expression, and the right operand (number 20) is passed as a method argument.

The name of each magic method is surrounded by double underscores (Pythonistas would say “dunder” for double underscores, as it’s a shorter and more convenient phrase). Dunders indicate that such methods are not called directly, but called in a process of expression evaluation, according to Python core syntax rules.

The '+' operator is in fact converted to the __add__() method and the len() function is converted to the __len__() method. These methods must be delivered by a class (now it’s clear why we treat classes as blueprints) to perform the appropriate action.

Pay attention to the fact that the __add__() method does not change any object attribute values – it just returns a value that is the result of adding the appropriate attribute values.

And in fact, the string class has its own implementation for the '+' operator, which is inherent to strings, different than implementations inherent to integers or floats.

When you design and implement your own classes and you want to make use of Python core syntax to operate on those class objects, you can easily achieve this by implementing the appropriate magic methods.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, weight, age, salary):
        self.weight = weight
        self.age = age
        self.salary = salary

    def __add__(self, other):
        return self.weight + other.weight


p1 = Person(30, 40, 50)
p2 = Person(35, 45, 55)

print(p1 + p2)
```

You could ask: how can I know what magic method is responsible for a specific operation?

The answer could be: start with the dir() and help() functions.

The dir() function gives you a quick glance at an object’s capabilities and returns a list of the attributes and methods of the object. When you call dir() on integer 10, you'll get:

```python
dir(10) 
['__abs__', '__add__', '__and__', '__bool__', '__ceil__', '__class__', '__delattr__', '__dir__', '__divmod__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__float__', '__floor__', '__floordiv__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getnewargs__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__index__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__int__', '__invert__', '__le__', '__lshift__', '__lt__', '__mod__', '__mul__', '__ne__', '__neg__', '__new__', '__or__', '__pos__', '__pow__', '__radd__', '__rand__', '__rdivmod__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__rfloordiv__', '__rlshift__', '__rmod__', '__rmul__', '__ror__', '__round__', '__rpow__', '__rrshift__', '__rshift__', '__rsub__', '__rtruediv__', '__rxor__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__sub__', '__subclasshook__', '__truediv__', '__trunc__', '__xor__', 'bit_length', 'conjugate', 'denominator', 'from_bytes', 'imag', 'numerator', 'real', 'to_bytes']
```

```python
help(10) 
Help on int object:
class int(object) 
	| int([x]) -> integer 
	| int(x, base=10) -> integer 
	| 
	| Convert a number or string to an integer, or return 0 if no arguments 
	| are given. If x is a number, return x.__int__(). For floating point 
	| numbers, this truncates towards zero. 
	| 
	| If x is not a number or if base is given, then x must be a string, 
	| bytes, or bytearray instance representing an integer literal in the 
	| given base. The literal can be preceded by '+' or '-' and be surrounded 
	| by whitespace. The base defaults to 10. Valid bases are 0 and 2-36. 
	| Base 0 means to interpret the base from the string as an integer literal. 
	| >>> int('0b100', base=0) 
	| 4 
	| 
	| Methods defined here: 
	| 
	| __abs__(self, /) 
	| abs(self) 
	| 
	| __add__(self, value, /) 
	| Return self + value. (...)
```

The Python help() function is used to display the documentation (if delivered!) of modules, functions, classes, and keywords. In our example, we have displayed the documentation for the built-in integer type. Look at the last lines of the output – it contains information about the __abs__ and __add__ special methods.

## Methods allowing access to containers

Containers are any object that holds an arbitrary number of other objects; containers provide a way to access the contained objects and to iterate over them. Container examples: list, dictionary, tuple, and set.

| Expression example       | Magic method                      | Implementation meaning or purpose                                              |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| len(container)           | ____len____(self)                 | returns the length (number of elements) of the container                       |
| container[key]           | ____getitem____(self, key)        | responsible for accessing (fetching) an element identified by the key argument |
| container[key] = value   | ____setitem____(self, key, value) | responsible for setting a value to an element identified by the key argument   |
| del container[key]       | ____delitem____(self, key)        | responsible for deleting an element identified by the key argument             |
| for element in container | ____iter____(self)                | returns an iterator for the container                                          |
| item in container        | ____contains____(self, item)      | responds to the question: does the container contain the selected item?        |

The list of special methods built-in in Python contains more entities. For more information, refer to [https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names).
