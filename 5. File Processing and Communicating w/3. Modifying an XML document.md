You've already learned how to parse an XML document. Time for the next step. Let's modify the element tree and create a new XML file based on it with the following movie data:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<data>
	<movie title="The Little Prince" rate="5"></movie>
	<movie title="Hamlet" rate="5"></movie>
</data>
```

Are you wondering if it will be difficult to convert book data to movie data? Thanks to the `xml.etree.ElementTree` module, it's a piece of cake.

![books > movies](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/1614c8ae31cca06ac0868b1c41dcf222809260e0.png)

To change the tag of the `Element` object, we must assign a new value to its `tag` property. Look at the code in the editor.

Result:

```python
movie {'title': 'The Little Prince'}
author : Antoine de Saint-Exupéry 
year : 1943 

movie {'title': 'Hamlet'} 
author : William Shakespeare 
year : 1603
```

In the example, during each iteration through the `book` elements, we replace them with the `movie` tag, and then make sure that all changes have gone through correctly.

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

tree = ET.parse('books.xml')
root = tree.getroot()
for child in root:
    child.tag = 'movie'
    print(child.tag, child.attrib)
    for sub_child in child:
        print(sub_child.tag, ':', sub_child.text)
```

Our XML has a few unnecessary elements, such as `author` and `year`. In order to remove them, we need to use the method called `remove`, provided by the `Element` class. Look at the code in the editor.

Result:

`movie {'title': 'The Little Prince'} movie {'title': 'Hamlet'}`

The remove method removes the child element passed as its argument, which must be an `Element` object. Note that for this purpose we use the method called `find`, which you're already familiar with.

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

tree = ET.parse('books.xml')
root = tree.getroot()
for child in root:
    child.tag = 'movie'
    child.remove(child.find('author'))
    child.remove(child.find('year'))
    print(child.tag, child.attrib)
    for sub_child in child:
        print(sub_child.tag, ':', sub_child.text)
```

Do you remember the `get` method that gets the value of the attribute? The `Element` object also has a method called `set`, which allows you to set any attribute. Look at the code in the editor.

Result:

```python
movie {'title': 'The Little Prince', 'rate': '5'}
movie {'title': 'Hamlet', 'rate': '5'}
```

The `set` method takes the attribute name and its value as arguments. In our case, we use it to set the highest rating for each of the movies.

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

tree = ET.parse('books.xml')
root = tree.getroot()
for child in root:
    child.tag = 'movie'
    child.remove(child.find('author'))
    child.remove(child.find('year'))
    child.set('rate', '5')
    print(child.tag, child.attrib)
    for sub_child in child:
        print(sub_child.tag, ':', sub_child.text)
```

You must have noticed that the modified XML document is not saved anywhere. To save all the changes we’ve made to the tree, we have to use the method called `write`.

The write method has only one required argument, which is a file name of the output XML file, or a file object opened for writing. In addition, we can define character encoding by using the second argument (the default is US-ASCII). To add a prolog to our document, we must pass `True` in the third argument.

Take a look at the example in the editor, in which we save the modified tree in a file called `movies.xml`.

The created file looks like this:

```xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?> 
<data>
	<movie rate="5" title="The Little Prince" />
	
	<movie rate="5" title="Hamlet" />
</data>
```

    child.remove(child.find('author'))
    child.remove(child.find('year'))
    child.set('rate', '5')
    print(child.tag, child.attrib)
    for sub_child in child:
        print(sub_child.tag, ':', sub_child.text)

tree.write('movies.xml', 'UTF-8', True)
```
