# Copying objects using shallow and deep operations

In this module, you’ll learn how to copy Python objects. Specifically, you'll learn about:

- object: label vs. identity vs. value;
- the _id()_ function and the _is_ operand;
- shallow and deep copies of the objects.

![Section summary concept](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/learning_objectives_python.png)

It’s hard to imagine writing a piece of Python code that performs any kind of data processing without making use of variables. As variables are fundamental elements that allow us to cope with objects, let's talk in detail about variables and objects, and possible ways of copying them.

When you spot the following clause:

```python
a_list = [ 1, 'New York', 100]
```  

you should understand it in the following way:

![Variable object](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/variable_object.png)

(Note that an assignment statement is being used, so evaluation of the right side of the clause takes precedence over the left side.)

- At first, an object (a list in this example) is created in the computer's memory. Now the object has its identity;
- then the object is populated with other objects. Now our object has a value;
- finally a variable, which you should treat as a label or name binding, is created, and this label refers to a distinct place in the computer memory.

What is that object 'identity'? Why are the object value and label not enough?

The built-in `id()` function returns the 'identity' of an object. This is an integer which is guaranteed to be unique and constant for this object during its lifetime. Two objects with non-overlapping lifetimes may have the same `id()` value.

CPython implementation detail: This is the address of the object in the memory. Don’t treat it as an absolute memory address.

Run the code presented in the right pane to see how the strings are located in the memory.

Remember that the memory addresses are different:

```python
a_string identity: 8466656 
b_string identity: 8466704
```

This function is rarely used in applications. More often you’ll use it to debug the code or to experiment while copying objects. The side effect of this infrequent use is that some developers forget about its existence and create their own variables titled `id` to store some kind of identity or identifier.

As a result, a variable called `id` shadows the genuine function and makes it unreachable in the scope in which the variable has been defined. You should remember to avoid such situations!

```python
a_string = '10 days to departure'
b_string = '20 days to departure'

print('a_string identity:', id(a_string))
print('b_string identity:', id(b_string))
```

When you have two variables referring to the same object, the return values of the `id()` function must be the same.

Run the code presented in the right pane to confirm our speculations:

```python
a_string identity: 8466704
b_string identity: 8466704
```

```python
a_string = '10 days to departure'
b_string = a_string

print('a_string identity:', id(a_string))
print('b_string identity:', id(b_string))
```

What is the difference between the `'=='` and `'is'` operators?

What should you do to compare two objects?

In order to compare two objects, you should start with the `'=='` operator as usual. This operator compares the values of both operands and checks for value equality. So here we witness a values comparison.

In fact, two distinct objects holding the same values could be compared, and the result would be 'True'. Moreover, when you compare two variables referencing the same object, the result would be also 'True'.

To check whether both operands refer to the same object or not, you should use the `'is'` operator. In other words, it responds to the question: “Are both variables referring to the same identity?”

```python
a_string = ['10', 'days', 'to', 'departure']
b_string = a_string

print('a_string identity:', id(a_string))
print('b_string identity:', id(b_string))
print('The result of the value comparison:', a_string == b_string)
print('The result of the identity comparison:', a_string is b_string)

print()

a_string = ['10', 'days', 'to', 'departure']
b_string = ['10', 'days', 'to', 'departure']

print('a_string identity:', id(a_string))
print('b_string identity:', id(b_string))
print('The result of the value comparison:', a_string == b_string)
print('The result of the identity comparison:', a_string is b_string)
```

The output is:

```python
a_string identity: 3687888
b_string identity: 3687888 
The result of the value comparison: True
The result of the identity comparison: True

a_string identity: 3689048
b_string identity: 9418632 
The result of the value comparison: True
The result of the identity comparison: False
```

This could be depicted as follows:

When you process the data, you’ll come to the point where you may want to have distinct copies of objects that you can modify without automatically modifying the original at the same time.

Let's have a look at the following code. Its intention is to:

- make a real, independent copy of `a_list`, (not just a copy reference). Using `[:]`, which is an array slice syntax, we get a fresh copy of the `a_list` object;
- modify the original object;
- see the contents of both objects.

Pay attention to the code presented in the right pane, of which `a_list` is a compound object (an object that contains other objects, like lists, dictionaries, or class instances).

When you run the code, you get the following output:

```python
print("Part 1")
print("Let's make a copy")
a_list = [10, "banana", [997, 123]]
b_list = a_list[:]
print("a_list contents:", a_list)
print("b_list contents:", b_list)
print("Is it the same object?", a_list is b_list)

print()
print("Part 2")
print("Let's modify b_list[2]")
b_list[2][0] = 112
print("a_list contents:", a_list)
print("b_list contents:", b_list)
print("Is it the same object?", a_list is b_list)
```

```python
Part 1
Let's make a copy 
a_list contents: [10, 'banana', [997, 123]] 
b_list contents: [10, 'banana', [997, 123]] 
Is it the same object? False

Part 2
Let's modify b_list[2] a_list contents: [10, 'banana', [112, 123]]
b_list contents: [10, 'banana', [112, 123]]
Is it the same object? False
```

> [!important]
> So, despite the fact that `b_list` is a copy of `a_list`, modifying `b_list` results in a modification of the `a_list` object.

The explanation of the behavior presented on the previous page is:

- the `'a_list'` object is a compound object;
- we’ve run a **shallow copy** that constructs a new compound object, `b_list` in our example, and then populated it with references to the objects found in the original;
- as you can see, a shallow copy is only one level deep. The copying process does not recurse and therefore does not create copies of the child objects, but instead populates `b_list` with references to the already existing objects.
  
![Variable object](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/deep_aaa_10a.png)

If you want to make an independent copy of a compound object (list, dictionary, custom class instance) you should make use of deep copy, which:

- constructs a new compound object and then, recursively, inserts copies into it of the objects found in the original;
- takes more time to complete, as there are many more operations to be performed;
- is implemented by the `deepcopy()` function, delivered by the python 'copy' module

The general idea should be depicted like this:

![mermaid_1](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/mermaid_1.png)

  

A code creating an independent copy of the `a_list` object should look like the code presented in the right pane.

The graphical representation should look like the following:

![deep_aaa_10b](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/deep_aaa_10b.png)

  

The 'copy' module contains a function for shallow copying: `copy()`. Of course, you could say that for copying lists there is already the `[:]` notation, or `a_list=list(b_list)`, and for dictionaries you could use `a_dict = dict(b_dict)`.

But think about making use of polymorphism when you need a universal function to copy any type object, so that in that case using a `copy()` function is the smart way to accomplish the task.

```python
import copy

print("Let's make a deep copy")
a_list = [10, "banana", [997, 123]]
b_list = copy.deepcopy(a_list)
print("a_list contents:", a_list)
print("b_list contents:", b_list)
print("Is it the same object?", a_list is b_list)

print()
print("Let's modify b_list[2]")
b_list[2][0] = 112
print("a_list contents:", a_list)
print("b_list contents:", b_list)
print("Is it the same object?", a_list is b_list)
```

```python
Let's make a deep copy
a_list contents: [10, 'banana', [997, 123]]
b_list contents: [10, 'banana', [997, 123]]
Is it the same object? False

Let's modify b_list[2]
a_list contents: [10, 'banana', [997, 123]]
b_list contents: [10, 'banana', [112, 123]]
Is it the same object? False
```

In the following example, we'll compare the performance of three ways of copying a large compound object (a million three-element tuples).

The first approach is a simple reference copy. This is done very quickly, as there’s nearly nothing to be done by the CPU – just a copy of a reference to 'a_list'.

The second approach is a shallow copy. This is slower than the previous code, as there are 1,000,000 references (not objects) created.

The third approach is a deep copy. This is the most comprehensive operation, as there are 3,000,000 objects created.

```python
import copy
import time

a_list = [(1,2,3) for x in range(1_000_000)]

print('Single reference copy')
time_start = time.time()
b_list = a_list
print('Execution time:', round(time.time() - time_start, 3))
print('Memory chunks:', id(a_list), id(b_list))
print('Same memory chunk?', a_list is b_list)

print()

print('Shallow copy')
time_start = time.time()
b_list = a_list[:]
print('Execution time:', round(time.time() - time_start, 3))
print('Memory chunks:', id(a_list), id(b_list))
print('Same memory chunk?', a_list is b_list)

print()

print('Deep copy')
time_start = time.time()
b_list = copy.deepcopy(a_list)
print('Execution time:', round(time.time() - time_start, 3))
print('Memory chunks:', id(a_list), id(b_list))
print('Same memory chunk?', a_list is b_list)
```


```python
Single reference copy
Execution time: 0.0
Memory chunks: 139798742885072 139798742885072
Same memory chunk? True

Shallow copy
Execution time: 0.01
Memory chunks: 139798742885072 139798742561248
Same memory chunk? False

Deep copy
... (LifeTime)
```

The same `deepcopy()` method could be utilized when you want to copy dictionaries or custom class objects.

The code on the right presents the code that safely copies the dictionary.

Run the code to get the following output:

```python
Memory chunks: 30996264 44045800
Same memory chunk? False
Let's modify the movies list a_dict movies: 
['Goldfinger (1964)', 'You Only Live Twice', 'Diamonds Are Forever (1971)'] b_dict movies: ['Goldfinger (1964)', 'You Only Live Twice']
```

```python
import copy

a_dict = {
    'first name': 'James',
    'last name': 'Bond',
    'movies': ['Goldfinger (1964)', 'You Only Live Twice']
    }
b_dict = copy.deepcopy(a_dict)
print('Memory chunks:', id(a_dict), id(b_dict))
print('Same memory chunk?', a_dict is b_dict)
print("Let's modify the movies list")
a_dict['movies'].append('Diamonds Are Forever (1971)')
print('a_dict movies:', a_dict['movies'])
print('b_dict movies:', b_dict['movies'])
```

The code in the editor copies the dictionary in a safe manner.

Run it to get the following output:

```python
import copy

class Example:
    def __init__(self):
        self.properties = ["112", "997"]
        print("Hello from __init__()")

a_example = Example()
b_example = copy.deepcopy(a_example)
print("Memory chunks:", id(a_example), id(b_example))
print("Same memory chunk?", a_example is b_example)
print()
print("Let's modify the movies list")
b_example.properties.append("911")
print('a_example.properties:', a_example.properties)
print('b_example.properties:', b_example.properties)
```

```python
Deep copy
Hello from __init__()
Memory chunks: 43986504 43986696 
Same memory chunk? False

Let's modify the movies list
a_example.properties: ['112', '997']
b_example.properties: ['112', '997', '911']
```

Pay attention to the fact that the `__init__()` method is executed only once, despite the fact we own two instances of the example class.

This method is not executed for the `b_example` object as the deepcopy function copies an already initialized object.

# Section summary

Important things to remember:

- the `deepcopy()` method creates and persists new instances of source objects, whereas any shallow copy operation only stores references to the original memory address;
- a deep copy operation takes significantly more time than any shallow copy operation;
- the `deepcopy()` method copies the whole object, including all nested objects; it’s an example of practical recursion taking place;
- deep copy might cause problems when there are cyclic references in the structure to be copied.
