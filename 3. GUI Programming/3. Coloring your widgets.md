# Adding colors

Nearly everything you put inside your windows may be **colored**. Most widgets have dedicated properties to handle their colors and we will tell you about them while discussing the widgets themselves. Currently, the most important thing is getting to know how the colors are described in `tkinter`, in other words, what means can you use to order the button to be red or blue.

There are at least three methods designed to meet your needs. We will tell you about them on the example of `Button` but don't forget that these ways are universal and can be used virtually everywhere.

![Fluffy unicorn dancing on a rainbow](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/cf5420c206bc50138dd6f0db5143098149892a47.png)

Let's check if tkinter understands **English** – look at the code in the editor, our test is there.

Note the two new arguments we use in the constructor invocation: `bg` (what is a short form of “_background-color_”) and `fg` (“_foreground-color_”). We went along the line of least resistance here – we've just made use of regular English names of colors and packed them inside strings.

Does it work? Let's check.

Yes, it definitely does:

![04.02.png](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/70cb175a5595ac3fd219156b9584e0bd90f414fb.png)

We encourage to you make some **clicks** on the button – it will unveil its little secret.

Can you see? The colors of the lowered (pressed) button are **gray** still. Why?

Because `fb` and `bg` refer to **raised** buttons only. There two additional parameters describing the second set of colors named `activeforeground` and `activebackground` respectively used by the event controller when the button is **pressed**. Do you want to check how they work? Do it boldly!

We can summarize the test's result saying that any of commonly used English color name can be used with `tkinter`. Don't bother if you want some of your widgets to be simply **white**, **black**, **green**, **gray** or even **grey**. It's easy and handy although not very precise.

Tkinter can do something more for you.

```python
import tkinter as tk

window = tk.Tk()
button = tk.Button(window, text="Button #1", bg="red", fg="yellow")
button.pack()
window.mainloop()
```

Tkinter recognizes over **750 predefined color names** – all of them can be found [here](http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TkCmd/colors.htm "here").

Feel free to use them – we've showed our try in the editor.

This is what we get:

![04.04-1.png](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/5206a9370d3c2f24994fbac246e17bc884313f76.png)

Yes, it definitely does:

The third method you can use is based on the fact that each color can be obtained by **mixing** (adding) **three primary colors**: **red** (R), **green** (G) and **blue** (B). The phenomenon is utilized by the so-called **RGB color model** which is one of the additive color models and it's widely used in many application, e.g. in color displays of different kinds.

One of the RGB model implementations allows you to set the **saturation** of every of primary colors in the range <0..255> what gives **256 different saturation levels**, from color's absence (saturation 0) to full color's presence (saturation 255).

Do you think it's not too much? Maybe, but don't forget that you mix three different colors (so-called **color components**) so the full spectrum consists of 256*256*256 = **16,777,216** colors. An average human can distinguish about 7 million colors, consequently, the model should work well and it really does.

Let's take a closer look at this.

```python
import tkinter as tk


window = tk.Tk()
button = tk.Button(window, text="Button #1",
                   bg="MediumPurple",
                   fg="LightSalmon",
                   activeforeground="LavenderBlush",
                   activebackground="HotPink")
button.pack()
window.mainloop()
```

When all the components are set to **zero** (absence of the colors), we get **black** as a result.

When all the components are set to **255** (full presence of the colors), we get **white** as a result.

![White & black figures](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/5962d87c63500bf8156dfa41c0ad1caad56105b9.png)

When one of the components is set to 255 while others are set to 0, we get one of the **primary colors** – red, green or blue.

![Red, green & blue figures](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/8f1acf99f047a9efcc1869647fcf5bd357c250f5.png)

Setting non-zero values for more than one component produces **intermediate colors**, e.g. red and blue set to 255 with green set to 0 gives the **violet**.

![Violet flower](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/831f9a3315b1d0240da59f50379a9700621fde5f.png)

It seems clear, doesn't it?

OK, but how to specify all these (more than 16 million) mixes in a comprehensive way?

It's is done by a trick used extensively in web pages – as a **string** starting with a **hash** (`#`) followed by **6 hexadecimal** digits. Each **pair of the digits** forms the value from range **0x00..0xFF** (0..255) what determines the specific component level.

This is how it works:

![#RRGGBB](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/ccf6a5ccb1f58c467efdc33f826afdaf80affa14.png)

All three pairs (RR, GG and GG) are **two-digit hexadecimal number** so:

- `#000000` is **black**
- `#FFFFFF` is **white**
- `#FF0000` is **red**
- `#00FF00` is **green**
- `#0000FF` is **blue**
- `#00FFFF` is **turquoise**
- `#FF00FF` is **violet**
- ...

Please, forgive us that we made that list so short. To tell the truth, we have no idea how to name each of these 16 million colors – do you?

Note: when all the components are set to the **same value**, equal neither to zero nor to 0xFF (e.g. `#0F0F0F0`), you will get **254 shades of gray**.

Look at the code in the editor. We want to show you you a little test showing how the RGB works:

Do the colors look the same as in the previous code?

They should look the same as we used RGB equivalents of the previously used `tkinter` color names.

Now try to find RGB codes for all your favorite colors. There are so many choices – don't feel lost!

![Different colors](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/2489becc9c414a0612ef6dcdc8e95900ce5c6682.png)

```python
import tkinter as tk

window = tk.Tk()
button = tk.Button(window, text="Button #1",
                   bg="#9370DB",
                   fg="#FFA07A",
                   activeforeground="#FFF0F5",
                   activebackground="#FF69B4")
button.pack()
window.mainloop()
```

# Building a GUI application from scratch

Now we're going to build a very simple and rather useless GUI application. Does that sound weird? Maybe, but the application, when ready, will make you more accustomed to some `tkinter` **habits** and **conventions**.

Our fabulous goal will look like the vision presented below:

![05.01.png](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/91f0e1c5e56195fb85c494b6b97ba60bbde58feb.png)

Are you ready? Let's start.

As everyone knows, Rome wasn't built in a day, and our application isn't an exception. We'll start with something absolutely **obvious** – we'll construct a window and launch an event controller – look at the code in the editor to see how to do it.

Our window looks like this one for now:

![05.02.png](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/dfcd77f033e60541fe00ce5c2ad687e6de7c346b.png)

There's nothing surprising yet. Let's add something to this dull gray area.

```python
import tkinter as tk

window = tk.Tk()
window.mainloop()
```

Our new friend is called `Label` – a non-clickable widget able to **present short textual information**, passed to the widget's constructor using a `text` argument. The text can later be changed at any moment of the widget's life.

As you can see, we're using the `pack()` geometry manager to compose the window.

Let's welcome `Label` into our window:

![05.04.png](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/bab27d96290b262a5e3121b3b72bbb70b758fb04.png)

Note: `pack()` resizes the window to a size large enough to fit all the packed widgets. This is its default behavior. Don't worry, the window will grow soon.

```python
import tkinter as tk

window = tk.Tk()

label = tk.Label(window, text = "Little label:")
label.pack()

window.mainloop()
```

Our next companion will be `Frame`.

A `Frame` is another non-clickable component used to **group widgets** and to separate them (visually) from other window components. Our `Frame` plays a less important role – it just occupies a rectangle and fills it with its own color. We expect nothing more for now.

Let's check it out.

This is how the `Frame` manifests its presence:

![05.06.png](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/c71e4b1417bbf153ec0f11602ce9abaff4f5463e.png)

Make our window great again.

```python
import tkinter as tk

window = tk.Tk()

label = tk.Label(window, text="Little label:")
label.pack()

frame = tk.Frame(window, height=30, width=100, bg="#000099")
frame.pack()

window.mainloop()
```

Our next component is completely **invisible**. You won't find it in the window area.

It's the switch variable. Can't you see it? It's set to hold an object of the `IntVar` class. This object is designed to store **integer** values. "Okay," you may say, "can't we use a regular variable instead?"

**No, we can't**. Objects of the `IntVar` class are used by `tkinter` to **organize internal communication between different widgets**. A regular variable can't play such a role.

If you want such an object to store an integer value, you can't use the assignment operator. The class offers a dedicated method for that purpose, and the method is named `set()`.

Note: we've used the method to store a value of `1` inside the object.

As the window's view hasn't changed, we can go directly to the next step.

```python
import tkinter as tk

window = tk.Tk()

label = tk.Label(window, text="Little label:")
label.pack()

frame = tk.Frame(window, height=30, width=100, bg="#000099")
frame.pack()

button = tk.Button(window, text="Button")
button.pack(fill=tk.X)

switch = tk.IntVar()
switch.set(1)

window.mainloop()
```

The next step adds a brand new widget to our window – it’s a `Checkbutton`.

It’s a **small square** which can be filled with a **tick mark**, or which can be empty.

The `Checkbutton` is primarily used to represent **two-state selections**. In other words, it can be in one of two possible states:

- the **ON** state when the `Checkbutton` is checked/ticked (which can be equated with an **affirmative answer** to some question)
- the **OFF** state when the `Checkbutton` is cleared (you can think of it as a kind of negative answer)

Take a look at the `Checkbutton` constructor – there’s something completely new. Can you see it?

Yes, it’s a `variable` argument. Note – it’s set to the previously created `switch` object. The assignment creates a **bidirectional link** between the object and the widget. How does it work?

- If you check or uncheck the `Checkbutton`, the switch object will **immediately change its state** – it will keep `0` if the widget is unchecked, and `1` otherwise.
- If you change the state of the `switch` object, the `Checkbutton` will **immediately reflect the change** – it means that you don’t need to access the `Checkbutton` itself to check/uncheck it, as you can modify the `switch` value instead.

Look, the `switch` is initially set to `1`. this means that the `Checkbutton` will be checked when it appears on the screen.

Let's check it.

```python
import tkinter as tk

win = tk.Tk()

label = tk.Label(win, text="Little label:")
label.pack()

frame = tk.Frame(win, height=30, width=100, bg="#000099")
frame.pack()

button = tk.Button(win, text="Button")
button.pack(fill=tk.X)

switch = tk.IntVar()
switch.set(1)

checkbutton = tk.Checkbutton(win, text="Check Button", variable=switch)
checkbutton.pack()

win.mainloop()
```

This is what our window looks like now:

![05.11.png](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/7b991f61bbbfc1d64e66450cadc6fc3337bca011.png)

Okay, it definitely looks as expected, but how can we be sure that the `switch` object changes its state according to our clicks addressed to the `Checkbutton`?

We’ll show you soon. Stay tuned.

Now we add a very important, and internally an extremely complicated, widget, named `Entry`. Look at the code in the editor.

`Entry` is designed to let the user enter simple, one-line data, like single numbers, names, addresses, etc.

We’ve added one to our window. It creates an **input field** 30 characters wide. You can play with it if you want, but it’s completely inoperative as far. We only want to show you what it looks like.

Isn’t our window lovely?

![05.13.png](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/d01fb260c36f3d70e660414b6d4c79d464fc562e.png)

Okay, let’s provide some serious work to our `switch` object.

```python
import tkinter as tk

window = tk.Tk()

label = tk.Label(window, text="Little label:")
label.pack()

frame = tk.Frame(window, height=30, width=100, bg="#000099")
frame.pack()

button = tk.Button(window, text="Button")
button.pack(fill=tk.X)

switch = tk.IntVar()
switch.set(1)

checkbutton = tk.Checkbutton(window, text="Check Button", variable=switch)
checkbutton.pack()

entry = tk.Entry(window, width=30)
entry.pack()

window.mainloop()
```

We’ve added two widgets at once – look!

These are the `Radiobuttons`, **small circles filled with a dot, or not**. The most important difference between `Check-` and `Radiobuttons` lies in the fact that `Checkbuttons` are **solitary** (they work individually) while `Radiobuttons` always work in groups and – note it! – only one of the widgets inside the group can be **checked**. Clicking an unchecked member of the group will cause the currently checked `Radiobutton` to change its state.

How do we achieve such an effect? The switch object will help us with it.

Our two `Radiobutton` constructors use **two additional arguments**. What roles do they play?

- The `variable` argument binds a `switch` object to both of the widgets, and this is the clue – the fact that both Radiobuttons are bound to the same object creates the group. Don’t forget that!
- The `value` argument distinguishes the `Radiobuttons` inside the group, and thus each of the `Radiobuttons` has to use a **different** value (we’ve used `0` and `1`)

The communication through the `switch` object should work as follows:

- selecting one of the `Radiobuttons` affects the `switch` object, which changes its value to **one of the possible values** specified in the `Radiobuttons`’ constructor; note: the mechanism works in the same way if there are more `Radiobuttons` in the group;
- simultaneously, changing the `switch` object’s state affects the `Radiobutton` group.

As the `switch` is initially set to `1`, we expect the second `Radiobutton` (named `Salad`) to be selected when the application starts.

Do you want to check it? Go ahead!

```python
import tkinter as tk

window = tk.Tk()

label = tk.Label(window, text="Little label:")
label.pack()

frame = tk.Frame(window, height=30, width=100, bg="#000099")
frame.pack()

button = tk.Button(window, text ="Button")
button.pack(fill=tk.X)

switch = tk.IntVar()
switch.set(1)

checkbutton = tk.Checkbutton(window, text="Check Button", variable=switch)
checkbutton.pack()

entry = tk.Entry(window, width=30)
entry.pack()

radiobutton_1 = tk.Radiobutton(window, text="Steak", variable=switch, value=0)
radiobutton_1.pack()
radiobutton_2 = tk.Radiobutton(window, text="Salad", variable=switch, value=1)
radiobutton_2.pack()

window.mainloop()
```

We hope we’ve lived up to your expectations:

![05.15-1.png](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/66d4f5785af5b3d7b378901e6178e952b476caed.png)

There is something more you should note. As the `Checkbutton` and `Radiobutton` groups are coupled together by the switch object, their changes are **synchronized**.

Check this carefully!

![05.15-2.png](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/b95ac1fb944c563f7aa4c9d4a596c477ec31502c.png)

If you check/uncheck the `Checkbutton`, the `Radiobutton` group will follow the change immediately and vice versa, while switching the active `Radiobutton` inside the group will automatically check/uncheck the `Checkbutton`.

Now you’re ready to dive deeper into `tkinter`.

Let’s dive together.

# Event handling

As you already know, events are the fuel which propel the application’s movements. All events come **to the event manager**, which is responsible for dispatching them to all the application components. This also means that some of the events may launch some of your callbacks, which makes you responsible for preparing the proper reactions to the user’s actions.

Now it’s time to show you some details of the events’ lives and anatomy. We’ll also show you how the events are able to influence a widget’s state, and how you control the event manager’s behavior.

For now, however, we want you to focus your attention on a very helpful method we’ll use to arrange communication between you and your application.

Of course, you can use the regular `print()` function to show messages and present a debug trace. The output will appear in the standard Python console, without affecting the application window. It’s okay if used in the early stages of development, but it’s very inelegant if you want the application to behave in a mature way.

The function we’ll use for our experiments is named `showinfo()`, it comes from the `messagebox` module, and it needs **two arguments** which are strings:

```python
messagebox.showinfo(title, info)
```

- the **first** string will be used by the function to **title the message box** which will appear on the screen; you can use an **empty** string, and the box will be **untitled** then;
- the **second** string is a message to display inside the box; the string can be of **any length** (but remember, the screen isn’t elastic and won’t stretch if you’re going to display a whole encyclopedia volume); note: you can use the `\n` digraph to visually break the info into separate lines.

We’ll ask the `showinfo()` function to show us its possibilities.

In the editor we've provided a very simple code demonstrating how `showinfo()` works:

Note the `\n` embedded inside the info string.

And this is what the final message box looks like:

![06.03.png](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/96c63e9ccfcbaa308d46fd1db46b2bd5f0673825.png)

```python
import tkinter
from tkinter import messagebox

def clicked():
    messagebox.showinfo("info", "some\ninfo")

window = tkinter.Tk()
button_1 = tkinter.Button(window, text="Show info", command=clicked)
button_1.pack()
button_2 = tkinter.Button(window, text="Quit", command=window.destroy)
button_2.pack()
window.mainloop()
```

If your widget is a **clickable** one, you can connect a callback to it using its `command` property, while the property can be initially set by the constructor invocation.

We’ve already practiced this, so the snippet in the editor won’t be a surprise to you.

Note – there are three widgets in all, but only one of them (the `Button`) is clickable by nature. Such a widget’s constructor is equipped with the `command` parameter, which is used to bind a callback.

The window along with its message box looks like this:

![06.05.png](https://edube.org/uploads/media/default/0001/01/745e6984292c8b7dde4a232315169b3c165be2e6.png)

```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox

def click():
    tk.messagebox.showinfo("Click!","I love clicks!")

window = tk.Tk()
label = tk.Label(window, text="Label")
label.pack()

button = tk.Button(window, text="Button", command=click)
button.pack(fill=tk.X)

frame = tk.Frame(window, height=30, width=100, bg="#55BF40")
frame.pack();

window.mainloop()
```

Some of the widgets (especially those that are not clickable by nature) **have neither a `command` property nor a constructor parameter of that name**.

Fortunately, you’re still able to bind a callback to any of the events it may receive (including clicks, of course) and this is done with a method named – it couldn’t be anything else – `bind()`:

```python
widget.bind(event, callback)
```

The `bind()` method needs two arguments:

- the `event` you want to launch your callback with;
- the `callback` itself.

Looks clear, doesn’t it?

Of course, there are two questions that should be answered immediately:

- **Q:** What is an event from the event controller’s point of view?  
    **A:** It’s an **object** carrying some useful info about what actually happens when the event has been induced (by the user or by another factor).
- **Q:** How are the events identified?  
    **A:** By **unique names** – each event has its own name and the name is just a unified string.

# Useful events

We’ve gathered some of the most usable event names – don’t try to learn them by heart.

|Event name|Event role|
|---|---|
|`<Button-1>`|Single left-click (if your mouse is configured for a right-handed user)|
|`<Button-2>`|Single middle-click|
|`<Button-3>`|Single right-click|
|`<ButtonRelease-1>`|Left mouse button release  <br>  <br>Note: there are also events named `<ButtonRelease-2>` and `<ButtonRelease-3>`|
|`<DoubleButton-1>`|Double left-click  <br>  <br>Note: there are also events named `<DoubleButton-2>` and `<DoubleButton-3>`  <br>  <br>Note again: the `<Button-1>` event is a part of `<DoubleButton-1>` too; if you assign a callback to `<Button-1>`, it will be launched, too!|

|Event name|Event role|
|---|---|
|`<Enter>`|Mouse cursor appears over the widget|
|`<Leave>`|Mouse cursor leaves the widget area|
|`<Focus-In>`|The widget gains the focus|
|`<Focus-Out>`|The widget loses the focus|
|`<Return>`|The user presses the _Enter/Return_ key|
|`<Key>`|The user presses **any** key|

|Event name|Event role|
|---|---|
|`x`|The user presses _x_ key (_x_ can be neither a space nor the < key)|
|`<space>`|The user presses the _spacebar_|
|`<less>`|The user presses the < key|
|`<Cancel>`|The user presses the key/keys used by the current OS to stop the program (e.g., _Ctrl-C_ or _Ctrl-Break_)|
|`<BackSpace>`|The user presses the _Backspace_ key|
|`<Tab>`|The user presses **Tab** key|

|Event name|Event role|
|---|---|
|`<Shift_L>`|The user presses one of the _Shift _keys__|
|`<Control_L>`|The user presses one of the _Control _keys__|
|`<Alt_L>`|The user presses one of the _Alt _keys__|
|`<Pause>`|The user presses the _Pause _key__|
|`<Caps_Lock>`|The user presses the _Caps Lock _key__|
|`<Esc>`|The user presses the _Escape _keys__|

|Event name|Event role|
|---|---|
|`<Prior>`|The _Page Up_ key|
|`<Next>`|The _Page Down_ key|
|`<End>`|The _End_ key|
|`<Home>`|The _Home_ key|
|`<Left>`  <br>  <br>`<Right>`  <br>  <br>`<Up>`  <br>  <br>`<Down>`|_Cursor_ (arrows) keys|
|`<Num_Lock>`  <br>  <br>`<Scroll_Lock>`|The two **Lock** keys|
|`<Shift-x>`  <br>  <br>`<Alt-x>`  <br>  <br>`<Control-x>`|The _x_ key has been pressed along with any of the _Shift_, _Alt_, or _Control_ keys|

Don’t be afraid if some of the events look a bit suspicious. You’ll get used to them soon.

Note:

- a callback designed for usage with the command property/parameter is a **parameterless** function;
- a callback intended to cooperate with the `bind()` method is a **one-parameter function** (the callback’s argument carries some info about the captured event)
- fortunately, it doesn’t mean that you have to define two different callbacks for those two applications, and this is how we’ll cope with the above requirements:  
      
```python
	def callback(ev=None): ...       
```
  
- the callback will work flawlessly in both of these contexts, and moreover, it’ll give you the chance to identify which one of the two possible styles of launch has just occurred.

We’re going to change our previous example a bit by making it sensitive to more than just one click.

We've provided the newer version of our code in the editor.

Pay attention to `Line I` and `Line II` in the above code. They show the way in which you can bind your callback to any of non-clickable widgets. The bind remains active to the end of the application’s work, but you can also manually unbind the event at any moment (and bind it again when you wish).

We encourage you to play with the code – test the behavior of some of the other events. It’ll be fun... we think.

We’ve said previously that an event is actually an object. Let’s shed some light on that.

```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox


def click(event=None):
    tk.messagebox.showinfo("Click!", "I love clicks!")


window = tk.Tk()
label = tk.Label(window, text="Label")
label.bind("<Button-1>", click)   # Line I
label.pack()

button = tk.Button(window, text="Button", command=click)
button.pack(fill=tk.X)

frame = tk.Frame(window, height=30, width=100, bg="#55BF40")
frame.bind("<Button-1>", click)   # Line II
frame.pack()

window.mainloop()
```

An event object is an instantiation of the `Event` class. Actually, it’s a container filled with some more or less helpful data. The data describe all the circumstances which are accompanied within the event, and it is dispatched to a number of the object’s properties.

```python
class Event: ...
```

Note: not all properties have meaning for every event. If the event is related to some of the mouse actions, the object’s parts referring to the keyboard remain uninitialized, and vice versa.

Let us show you some of the properties.

|Property name|Property role|
|---|---|
|`widget`|The widget’s **object** (not the widget’s name!) to which the event is addressed|
|`<x>`  <br>  <br>`<y>`|The mouse cursor’s **coordinates** at the moment of the event’s occurrence (both coordinates are counted relative to the target widget)|
|`<x_root>`  <br>  <br>`<y_root>`|As above, but relative to the **screen**|
|`<char>`|The pressed key **character code** (only for keyboard events)|
|`<keysym>`|The pressed key symbol (only for keyboard events)  <br>The full list of all recognized key symbols is presented here: [https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TkCmd/keysyms.htm](https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TkCmd/keysyms.htm)|
|`<keycode>`|The pressed key **numerical** code (only for keyboard events)  <br>Don’t confuse this with `char`, which is the ASCII/UNICODE code of the character bound to the key|
|`<num>`|The number of the clicked mouse **button** (only for mouse events)|
|`<type>`|The event’s type|

Let’s modify our code again. We want it to unveil some info coming in with the event object. Look at the code in the editor.

We encourage you again to carry out some experiments with this code. Use it to discover the event’s anatomy in detail.

A callback bound to a certain event may be **unbound** at any moment.

Let’s analyze the process in relation to clickable widgets i.e., those having the `command` property and using the command constructor’s parameter.

If you unbind a callback from an event, the widget **stops reacting** to the event. If you want to reverse this action, you must **bind the callback again**.

We haven’t said a word on modifying a widget’s properties, and we’re going to discuss it thoroughly in the next section, so please forgive us for only doing it briefly now.

If you want to modify a property named `prop`, existing within a widget named `wid`, and you’re going set its value to `val`, you can use the `config()` method, just like here:

```python
wid.config(prop=val)
```

This means that if you want to unbind your current callback from a `Button` named `b1`, you would use an invocation like this one:

```python
b1.config(command = lambda: None)
```

This binds an empty (i.e., doing absolutely nothing) function to the widget’s callback.

Let’s test it.

```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox


def click(event=None):
    if event is None:
        tk.messagebox.showinfo("Click!", "I love clicks!")
    else:
        string = "x=" + str(event.x) + ",y=" + str(event.y) + \
                 ",num=" + str(event.num) + ",type=" + event.type
        tk.messagebox.showinfo("Click!", string)        


window = tk.Tk()
label = tk.Label(window, text="Label")
label.bind("<Button-1>", click)
label.pack()

button = tk.Button(window, text="Button", command=click)
button.pack(fill=tk.X)

frame = tk.Frame(window, height=30, width=100, bg="#55BF40")
frame.bind("<Button-1>", click)
frame.pack()

window.mainloop()
```

Our application creates a window with two buttons in it. The first one works as an on/off switch, while the switch changes the behavior of the second button. When the switch is ON, clicking the second button activates a message box. When the switch if OFF, clicking the second button has no effect. Moreover, the second button’s title changes according to the switch’s state.

Note the method we use to change the button’s title.

The two faces of our window look like this:

Now we’ll do the same trick again, but this time with the non-clickable widget.

To unbind a callback previously bound with the `bind()` method invocation, you need to use the `unbind()` method:

```python
widget.unbind(event)
```

The method requires one argument identifying the event being unbound.

Note: the information about a previously used callback is **lost**. You cannot retrieve it automatically and you must repeat the `bind()` invocation.

Let’s jump into the code.

```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox


def on_off():
    global switch
    if switch:
        button_2.config(command=lambda: None)
        button_2.config(text="Gee!")
    else:
        button_2.config(command=peekaboo)
        button_2.config(text="Peekaboo!")
    switch = not switch


def peekaboo():
    messagebox.showinfo("", "PEEKABOO!")


def do_nothing():
    pass


switch = True
window = tk.Tk()
buton_1 = tk.Button(window, text="On/Off", command=on_off)
buton_1.pack()
button_2 = tk.Button(window, text="Peekaboo!", command=peekaboo)
button_2.pack()
window.mainloop()
```

The main tkinter window has a method named bind_all() which binds a callback to all currently existing widgets.

There is also a method named `unbind_all()` which reverts the first method’s effects.

```python
window.bind_all(event, callback)
window.unbind_all(event)
```

We used the `bind_all()` method to bind the one and the same callback to all three widgets, whether clickable or not. Look at the code we've provided in the editor.

Play with the code. Don’t worry, it’s safe.

Now we’re going to take you on a trip to Widget land. It’ll be an exciting journey, we promise.
